				<h1> What is this shit? </h1>
				<p>This shit is a <strong>joke</strong> attempt at implementing some very basic
				class and object semanthics, including inheritance and polimorphism,
				in an example C program. It is awful, and should <strong>never</strong> be used in any
				real project. It has no type safety, it is very easy to break, and you
				could easily introduce segfaults in it. But, it kinda works. Wait,
				doesn't that literally describe the C language in the first place? </p>

				<p> You might be wondering: why I made this? The answer is simple.
					For I am moved by macabre curiosity and a strong desire to see
					chaos and destruction. And the easiest way to achieve that, is to 
					mess around with C. </p>

				<h1> Why this works? </h1>
				<p> The trick is actually very simple. We implement classes as a normal
				C struct that has function pointers inside of it, for the "methods". We implement
				constructors for it, that constructs the objects and returns them as a void*, which
				allows us to use inheritance stuff like declaring an object of the superclass and
				instantiating it as an object of the subclass.</p>

				<p> All methods of a certain class must receive a pointer to the very same object
				as a parameter. Languages like python do that in an implicit form, by using "self".
				C isn't that smart. However, we do have a convenient macro to call methods without 
				having to pass that parameter.</p>

				<h1> Why this shouldn't work. </h1>
				<li> The "inheritance and polymorphism" in this program is actually achieved 
				by using void* to trick the compiler into believing my object is of a type it 
				actually isn't. In any sane language, this shouldn't be possible, for obvious reasons.
				But C is not a sane language. C allows you to lie to the compiler and get away with it.
				This program is an illusion made of lies. </li>
				<br>
				<li> To exemplify the problem, let us take a look at this very example. We have two classes
					there: Birb, and Parrot, which is a subclass of Birb. Well, it isn't actually a subclass of
					Birb, for C does not have such a notion. What it actually is, is a struct that has a pointer
					to a Birb object in it, the so called "super". The constructor for the parrot class, however,
					returns a <strong>void*</strong>, which you can convert to a normal Birb* type. By doing that,
					you can, for example, have an array of Birb* with both normal Birbs and Parrots in it. 
					<strong> But here lies the problem </strong>: let's suppose the Parrot class has an attribute
					Birb doesn't have (which is expected in an inheritance scenario), and a method that uses this 
					very attribute. Our void* black magic would allow us to try and call that method with a Birb* 
					object, and the result would be <strong>Segmentation Fault (core dumped).</strong> </li>
				<br>
				<li> TLDR it's super easy to break this shit </li>
				<br>

				<br>
				<p> Oh, and by the way, there's no destructor implemented yet. We leak memory for greater good </p>

				<h2> Update: objects now have some way of knowing their type </h2>

				<p> But don't get your hopes high, you still have to check it manually, so the risk
					of segfault stands. What we now have is some sort of identifier you can assign 
				to each class, such as an element of an enum (which is what I did on the example) </p>

				<br>
				<img src="screenshot5.png" width="100%">
				<br>

				<p> With that, you can manually check the type of an object before potentially
				calling some method you shouldn't... Well, you shouldn't be using this code
				in the first place so this doesn't matter. </p>
